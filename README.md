Localghost
==========

Usage
-----

*Localghost* is a simple status menu thinger to make it so that you can set up
a set of hosts that you use for development and quickly point them to localhost.

Once *Localghost* starts you'll see a preferences menu where you can add the
hosts that you use for development.  Once added they'll appear in the
*Localghost* status menu and can be turned on and off with one click (well,
almost, it'll ask for your password once per session).
